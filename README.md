## React Faux Slider

### Overview:
You are tasked with creating a "faux image slider". Here are the steps we would like you to follow:

- Make an AJAX GET request to `http://react-code-test.graftonstudio.com/thumbnails/api` to receive an array of JSON data.
- The array you receive should contain four objects with the following example structure:
```
{
  "thumbnail_url": "http://react-code-test.graftonstudio.com/thumbnails/pexels-photo-1428787.jpeg",
  "thumbnail_content": "This will be filled with dumby text content."
}
